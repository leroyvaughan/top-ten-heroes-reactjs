# My Top Ten Heroes

## My second ReactJS app.

I've been doing JavaScript for many, many years...going way back to the days of the comet cursor (1999).  I can safely say its been about 20 years; and counting++.
With that said, I've can include simple things I've done with JavaScript: like DHTML and JQuery.  After those I moved onto doing stuff with Google Maps, Google Visualizations, DevExpress Web Controls, KnockoutJS, and then a small bit of Angular.  I did the Angular just to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript and how my years of Software Development allow me to learn things rapidly.

In 2017, I started doing NodeJs for our product at YGEIA Group.  I originally used Jade Views, which were pretty darn close to ASP.Net MVC views.  The concept was familiar and the learning curve was very slight.  Two years later, Jade Views aren't so popular...

It appears that NodeJs and ReactJs are like Peanut Butter and Jelly.  So, because I know NodeJs pretty well, I decided to do some ReactJs apps to display my Software Development 'prowess'.  Also, so I could incorporate it into my projects at YGEIA group and obsolete the Jade Views.

This is another redo of My Top Ten Heroes, which was originally done with Angular 2; but with a spruced up UI and a database this time.

*Also, for the homepage (heroes list) I used my own NPM Module: 'react-coverflow-mod', which is a fork of 'react-coverflow' with some slight modifications.


Here's the running app online:
